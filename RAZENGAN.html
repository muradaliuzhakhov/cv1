    <p>The Rasengan was created by Minato Namikaze, which he based on the Tailed Beast Ball.
      [2] He spent three years creating the Rasengan,[3] which he intended to be the highest
      form of shape transformation. Because it represents the high form of shape transformation,
      mastering the Rasengan also grants the user a great deal of mastery over shape transformation,
      even if they are unaware of the concept of shape transformation.[4] Like many of Minato's jutsu,
      the Rasengan does not require hand seals to perform. Once it is formed, it also does not require
      any additional chakra to sustain it, which means that there is no definite limit to how long the
      Rasengan can be maintained. However, the Rasengan will dissipate if it collides with something, even
      if it's an unintended target. Though the Rasengan's shape is consistent from user to user, its size
      varies from only barely large enough to be noticeable to much larger than the user's hand.
      Greater experience with the Rasengan allows the user to create them in a larger size, and even one in each hand.</p>
